# TowersofHanoi
Towers-of-Hanoi is a program to demonstrate recursion. This allows us to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle by performing repetitive steps for any number of discs.

Towers of Hanoi was invented by Eduoard Lucas in the 1800's. A Hindu temple is claimed to have implemented this puzzle long ago to increase the mental discipline of young priests.

-The goal is to take a stack of discs from 1 peg to another, never allowing a larger disc to stack upon a smaller one.
-You are given only 3 pegs to complete this task, starting on the 1st and you must end at the 3rd.

This program solves this puzzle for up to 100 discs.
