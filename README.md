# TowersofHanoi
This program is a Computer Science 2 (CS145) project at Whatcom Community College, Spring 2023.

Towers of Hanoi was invented by Eduoard Lucas in the 1800's.
A Hindu temple implemented this puzzle long ago to increase the mental discipline of young priests.
The goal is to take a stack of discs from 1 peg to another, never allowing a larger disc to stack upon a smaller one,
you are given only 3 pegs to complete this task, starting on the 1st and you must end at the 3rd.

This program solves this puzzle for up to 100 discs.
